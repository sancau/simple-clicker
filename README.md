# simple-clicker
A simple clicking game implemented with OpenGL (C++ / FreeGLUT lib)

Just a fun project I did a while ago. Using OpenGL with C++ was quite an interesting exprerience.
The code has no structure and generaly ugly but I'm not going to fix it. Let it remind me I've learned a lot over time. :)
